sVimPy-0.1a

sVimPy is a very small Python virtual machine intended for use in microcontroller projects.

At the moment, it supports about 3/4 of all opcodes used in python3k.
Most data types are supported.
The intended goal is to use this VM in environments like Atmel's ATmega chips (2-8kb RAM).
The microcontroller bootloader is still missing (no arduinos left for experimentation).
Classes are not supported.
Features include: 

 * function calling
 * a stack based VM
 * garbage collection
 * very low memory usage
 * an interactive debugging console
 * dictionaries and tuples
 * iterations 
 * VM single stepping (game loop usage is possible)
 * C function calling,
 * a small memory footprint
 * fast performance
 * the ability to be used as a library in other projects
 * simple API + code
 * possible usage as a small deployment executable for Python projects
